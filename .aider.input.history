+ • Add a button labeled “Add Entry” that adds the written note to a visible list below.
+ • Below the input, show a section titled “Your Risk Journal” displaying all saved notes in order.
+ • Each entry should include a small “Delete” button allowing the user to remove that specific note.
+ • Add a “Clear All” button that removes every entry from the journal at once.
+ • If the user tries to add an empty note, show a message:
+“Please enter a note before adding.”
+
+UI Requirements:
+ • Use only basic interface elements: text fields, buttons, and a list.
+ • Keep the layout clean and easy to understand.
+ • All interactions must update instantly and locally within the app.
